## Problem 1

```{r, echo = FALSE} 
library (moderndive) 
library(tidyverse)
```

Now I will load the `early_january_weather` dataset.

```{r}
data("early_january_weather")
```

* The `early_january_weather` dataset has the information about weather of the first half month of January in 2013 in EWR, which collected data including temperature, dewpoint, humid, wind_dirction, wind_speed, wind_gust, pressure, visibility, etc.

* There are `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns in the dataset.

* The mean temperature is `r mean (pull(early_january_weather, temp))`.
