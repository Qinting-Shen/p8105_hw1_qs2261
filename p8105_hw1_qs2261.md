Now I will load the `early_january_weather` dataset

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

- The `early_january_weather` dataset has the information about weather
  of the first half month of January in 2013 in EWR, which collected
  data including temperature, dewpoint, humid, wind_dirction,
  wind_speed, wind_gust, pressure, visibility, etc.

- There are 358 rows and 15 columns in the dataset.

- The mean temperature is 39.58 F.

Now I will make a scatterplot of `temp` and `time_hour`

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_qs2261_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

- This scatterplot indicates that the temperature fluctuated up and down
  every day, and the temperature shows an overall rising trend, reaching
  the highest temperature on the 14th. The humidity from Jan 11th to
  14th remained a high level (\>80).

Save the scatterplot:

``` r
ggsave("scatterplot.png")
```

## Problem 2

Create a dataframe, including

1.  `samp`: a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal
    distribution
2.  `log_vec`: a logical vector indicating whether elements of the
    sample are greater than 0
3.  `char_vec`: a character vector of length 10
4.  `fac_vec`: a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor
    “levels”

``` r
hw1_df= tibble(
  samp = rnorm(10),
  log_vec = samp>0,
  char_vec = c ("A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J"),
  fac_vec = factor(c("small","medium","large","small","medium","large","small","medium","small","large"))
)
```

Now take the mean of each variable:

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.5164763

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, log_vec))
```

    ## [1] 0.3

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, char_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, char_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, fac_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, fac_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

- when calculating the mean, random `samp` and `log_vec` works, while
  `char_vec` and `fac_vec` don’t work since they are not numeric or
  logical.

Write a code chunk that applies the `as.numeric` function to the
logical, character, and factor variables

``` r
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,log_vec))
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,char_vec))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,fac_vec))
```

- logival_vector: true value was converted to 1, and false value was
  converted to 0. So, we can calculate the mean of logical vector.
- character_vector: this variable is character type, so it failed to
  converted to numeric, that’s why I got a waring message saying “NAs
  introduced by coercion”. Thus, we cannot calculate the mean of
  character vector.
- factor_vector: it was converted to number from 1 to 3 following some
  rules of rank. Although it can be converted to numeric format, they
  are not true numeric values, so we cannot calculate the mean.
